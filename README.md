# Implementing VSE-based Association between EVCC and SECC according to ISO 15118 part 8

## Background
International standard for EV charging, ISO 15118, defines the communication between EV (Electric Vehicle) and EVSE (EV Supply Equipment, aka EV-Charger). The original standard published in 2014 assumes that EV and EVSE communicate by TCP/IP over PLC (Power Line Communication, GreenPHY) using the charging cable. In 2018, ISO also published ISO 15118 part 8, "Physical layer and data link layer requirements for wireless communication", enabling possibilities for EV and EVSE to communicate over wireless medium. IEEE 802.11n (High Throughput WiFi) was chosen for this communication. 

This standard (ISO 15118 part 8) defines requirements for EVCC (EV's communication controller) and SECC (EVSE's communication controller) in order to allow the followings:
- SECC can announce its presence as a ISO15118-compliant SECC and compatible charging services it can provide
- EVCC can discover and associate to a nearby SECC that is compatible to EV user's needs for charging
- EVCC and SECC can maintain reliable communication throughout the charging session

At the heart of EV/EVSE discovery and association is VSE (Vendor-Specific Elements) in the management frames of 802.11: Beacon, Probe Request/Response, Association Request, and Reassociation Request. VSE can deliver service profile (SECC) or charging profile (EVCC) so that EVCC and SECC can selectively associate with each other based on the compatibility of the two. To implement ISO-compliant EVs and EVSEs, one needs to add necessary VSEs in 802.11 management frames and allow EVCC and SECC to make association decisions based on the compatibility with each other.

## Goals
In this project, we aimed to provide a simple and easy software solution for setting up an SECC and EVCC using open source tools. In particular, we achieved the followings:
- Setup an SECC, a ISO-compliant 802.11n AP (Access Point), using HostAP (modified) and unix/linux shell scripts
- Setup an EVCC, a ISO-compliant 802.11n STA (Station), using Atheros drivers and unix/linux shell scripts.

## Features
EVCC and SECC provided in this project can do the followings:

### SECC
- SECC acts as an 802.11n access point (in dual mode, both 2GHz and 5GHz)
- SECC can broadcast beacon messages with VSEs according to ISO 15118-8
- SECC can selectively allow an EVCC to associate based on the compatibility of the EV's VSE with its own

### EVCC
- EVCC acts as an 802.11n station (client, either 2GHz and 5GHz)
- EVCC can perform active scanning (Probe Request) and determine to which AP to associate based on the VSE-compatibility
- EVCC can associate to the SECC with compatible VSEs and the strongest signal strength, if any

### TODOs 
- Reassociation tests are to be done
- Simultaneous dual band support of SECC needs to be tested using dual-mode interface
